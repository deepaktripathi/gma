                        <p>Dear Parents,</p>
                        <p>The main aim of education is an all round development drawing out the best in the child and man body, mind and spirit” (Mahatma Gandhi).  It means whatever potential and talent is within the child will come out and personality grows.  Education helps children grow and think intensively. Intelligence plus character that is the goal of true education.</p>
                        <p>Our goal is to fill every child’s mind with the awareness that every child is important and significant, and is born to do something remarkable, creative and original without disrupting the goodness and virtues innate in every child.</p>
                        <p>We try to make this school a temple of wisdom and knowledge in the real sense.  Our goal is to fill every child’s mind with the awareness that every child is important and significant and is born to do something remarkable, creative and original without disputing the goodness and virtues innate in every child.</p>
