                        <p>“Focus on the journey, not the destiny.  Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.”</p>
                        <p>Learning is a process of constantly updating in an ever changing world. The first five years are the most rapid changes of life and are critical in a child’s development. Children develop rapidly during this time, physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially also, the earliest years of a child’s life is a key of prediction of ultimate success in their school and personal life.  The period from the age of three years until the beginning of class 1, in a mainstream school is called the foundation stage of learning.  All the children should be given the opportunity to experience the very best possible start their education.</p>
                        <p>Learning at our school is based on the fundamental principles of life, teaching the children to be courageous, confident, disciplined, responsible and loyal.  Education at our school provides a foundation for a lifetime of learning and great fun too.</p>
                        <p>Teaching at G.M. Academy is two way process, where the teachers first try and understand each individual child.  So as to provide them with the most easy and adoptable techniques and a conducive ambience for them to learn what is delivered.  We believe in teaching by following the child.  We strive to keep our toddlers busy with learning activities.</p>
                        <p>Today the role of a school is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to empower its students to be lifelong learners.  We try to provide the best possible environment for healthy development of young children by providing a carefully planned and structured environment in which the child grows and learns in a natural way.</p>
                        <p>I would take this opportunity to thank the parents of our students for having bestowed their faith and confidence in us.  Your faith in us is our drawing force.</p>
                        <p>I would like to end with the words of Albert Einstein saying, “Imagination is more important than knowledge – for while knowledge defines all that we currently know and understand imagination points to all we might yet discover and create”</p>
